title: Online Workshop - The State of the Art in Scientific Coupling Technology for HPC
---

### 3<sup>rd</sup> December 2021 13:00 - 16:30 GMT

As part of the UKRI [ExCALIBUR](https://excalibur.ac.uk) programme, this cross-cutting project *Integrated Simulation at the Exascale: coupling, synthesis and performance* looks to understand, develop and integrate cutting-edge coupling technologies within the UK's exascale capability.

This workshop represents the first in a new series curated by the project and will look in detail at the key open coupling technologies currently available that are specifically designed for use in HPC environments.
